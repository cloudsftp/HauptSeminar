\subsection{Representations}

The \textbf{representation} $\rho$ of a group $G$ is defined as a group homomorphism $\rho: G \to \GL(V)$.
This means that $\rho$ preserves the structure of $G$.
So the diagram in \Cref{fig:main.what.rep-cd} commutes.
As you can infer from the diagram, the representation $\rho$ does not have to preserve \textit{all} structure of $G$.
The simplest representation therefore only has to preserve the structure, that every $g \in G$ is an element of $G$.
This is ridiculously trivial and you can see that it is a valid representation for any group $G$.
It is called the \textbf{trivial representation} and is defined as $\triv: G \to \GL(V): g \mapsto \id_V$~\cite{hein2013}.

\subsection{Faithful Representations}
\label{sec:basics.rep.faith}

A representation that preserves \textit{all} structure of the group $G$ it represents, is called \textbf{faithful}.
Such a representation $\rho$ has to be injective, meaning that $\rho(a) = \rho(b) \implies a = b$ for any $a, b \in G$~\cite{hein2013}.
Since $\rho$ is injective, we can define an inverse map on its image $\rho^{-1}: \Ima(\rho) \to G: \rho^{-1}(\rho(g)) = g$.
For this inverse map, the diagram in \Cref{fig:main.what.faith-rep-cd} also commutes.
There is an easy way to construct such a representation for any finite group $G$, the resulting representation is called the \textbf{regular representation} with notation $\reg$.
The idea is to let the group act on itself~\cite{fulton2013}.
First, we need to identify each element $g \in G$ with a basis vector of $\C^n$.
It is immediately clear, that we need $n \geq |G|$ dimensions of our vector space.
We choose the smallest number of dimensions needed, $n = |G|$.
Next, we construct the matrices $\reg(a)$ for every action $a \in G$ to reflect, how the elements are mapped to each other by the action $a$.
The following is an example, of how this can be done for the group $\Z/2\Z$.
First, we construct a mapping $\pi: (\Z/2\Z) \to \C^2$:
\begin{align*}
    \pi: \qquad & 0 \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}^T \\
    & 1 \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}^T
\end{align*}
Next, we construct the matrices $\reg(a)$:
\begin{align*}
    0: \qquad & 0 + 0 = 0,\ 0 + 1 = 1 \\
    \implies & \reg(0) = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 \\
        0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix} \\
    1: \qquad & 1 + 0 = 1,\ 1 + 1 = 0 \\
    \implies & \reg(1) = \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 \\
        1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
Since the action $0$ maps each element of $\Z/2\Z$ to itself, its representation is the identity matrix.
The action $1$ maps each element of $\Z/2\Z$ to the only other element in $\Z/2\Z$, therefore its representation is the matrix that swaps both coordinates of $\C^2$.

For each regular representation, there is a change of basis that causes all matrices of the representation to become block matrices.
This property is called \textbf{semisimplicity} and was proven by Maschke~\cite{maschke1899}.
It is not true for vector spaces over the field of rational numbers but is for complex numbers.
That is the reason, why finite vector spaces in this document are always $\C^n$.
This is the reason, why chose $\C$ as the field for defining finite vector spaces and matrix properties.
More on semisimplicity later in \Cref{sec:reprep.simp}.
As an example for our previously constructed representation of $\Z/2\Z$, the base change matrix, that achieves this is
\begin{align*}
    & A = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 1 \\
        1 & -1
    \end{pmatrix} \\
    0: \qquad & A^{-1} \cdot \reg(0) \cdot A = A^{-1} \cdot I \cdot A = A^{-1} \cdot A = I \\
    1: \qquad & A^{-1} \cdot \reg(0) \cdot A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 1 \\
        1 & -1
    \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 \\
        1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 1 \\
        1 & -1
    \end{pmatrix} \\
    & = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 1 \\
        1 & -1
    \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & -1 \\
        1 & 1
    \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
        2 & 0 \\
        0 & -2
    \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 \\
        0 & -1
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}

This representation maps all group elements to permutation matrices, per construction.
In particular, it maps all group elements to different permutation matrices, since the representation is faithful.
We need this observation for a later proof in \Cref{sec:reprep.char}.
