    This document is an introduction to representation theory.
    The document starts with an introduction to the idea and applications of representation theory.
    After that, the document introduces all lesser-known mathematical concepts needed to understand representation theory, as well as facts used in later proofs.
    Then the basics of representation theory are presented.
    Such as the definition of representations, their properties, and equivalence of representations.
    After that, we will take a look at how representations can be classified as this brings structure into the set of representations a group can have.
    Here, the most important results of representation theory are presented.
    At last, we will classify the representations of the symmetric group $S_3$ as an example.
    This will also give us an application for cryptography.
