\subsection{Infinite Representation}

An example of an infinite-dimensional representation of a group would be the infinite-dimensional representation of the group $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$.
It is the group of all $2 \times 2$ real matrices with a determinant of one.
From this definition, you can immediately see, that there exists at least one finite-dimensional representation of this group.

To describe this infinite-dimensional representation, we first need to find generators of the group $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$.
In this case, there are three and we will call them $E$, $F$, and $H$.
They need to satisfy the following equations:
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        [H, E] & = 2E \\
        [H, F] & = -2F \\
        [E, F] & = H
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $[A, B] = A \cdot B - B \cdot A$ is the so called commutator of $A$ and $B$.
The matrices satisfying these equations are
\begin{align}
    H = -i \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 \\
        -1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}, \qquad
    E = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & i \\
        -i & 1
    \end{pmatrix}, \text{ and} \qquad
    F = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & -i \\
        -i & 1
    \end{pmatrix} 
\end{align}

For the representation, we need an infinite-dimensional vector space $V$.
We don't need to think about what it looks like, just assume it has an infinite number of basis vectors $\{\ldots, v_{-1}, v_0, v_1, \ldots\}$.
We now construct a representation on a subspace of this vector space $V$ by choosing a $\lambda \in \C$.
The representation $\rho(a) \in \GL(V)$ of an action $a \in \text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ is then given by
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        \rho(H) \cdot v_n & = n \cdot v_n \\
        \rho(E) \cdot v_n & = \frac{\lambda + n + 1}{2} \cdot v_{n + 2} \\
        \rho(F) \cdot v_n & = \frac{\lambda - n - 1}{2} \cdot v_{n - 2}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
To obtain the representation $\rho(a)$ for any action $a \in \text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$, you first need to write it as some combination of $H$, $E$, and $F$ then you can combine the given linear for every element given above like you combined the elements.
From these three formulas, one can see that the resulting maps on $V$ are indeed linear.
Also, we don't need all basis vectors, we only need either all the ones with even indices or the ones with odd indices~\cite{borcherds2011}.

These representations are irreducible, if and only if neither $\rho(E) \cdot v_n = 0$ nor $\rho(F) \cdot v_n = 0$ for some $n$.
Otherwise, there would be an opportunity to cut the vector space around that index $n$.
Such a thing happens if $\lambda \in \mathbb{Z}$.
So if we choose $\lambda \in \C \setminus \mathbb{Z}$, the representation above will be infinite and irreducible~\cite{borcherds2011}.
