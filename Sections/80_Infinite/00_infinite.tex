\section{Infinite Groups and Representations}

The way of writing down representations of groups that was introduced in the last section does not work for all groups and representations.
If the group has an infinite number of conjugacy classes, we cannot write down the character.
Also if the representation is infinite-dimensional, meaning the vector space its elements act on is infinite-dimensional, the trace may not be defined.
So we can't write down the character either.
In this section we encounter examples for both cases, starting with an infinite group.
