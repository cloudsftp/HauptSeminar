\subsection{Linear Algebra}

A \textbf{vector space} over a field $F$ is a set $V$ with two operations, addition $+: V \times V \to V$ and scalar multiplication $\cdot: F \times V \to V$, that satisfy some axioms.
Since vector spaces are a common concept in computer science, I will omit the axioms here.
This work focuses on vector spaces over the complex numbers $\C$.
A $n$-dimensional complex vector space is denoted $\C^n$.
Its elements are written as follows.
\begin{align}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        i \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix} \in \C^2
\end{align}
