\subsection{Linear Algebra}

A \textbf{vector space} over a field $F$ is a set $V$ with two operations, addition $+: V \times V \to V$ and scalar multiplication $\cdot: F \times V \to V$, that satisfy some axioms.
Since vector spaces are a common concept in computer science, I will omit the axioms here.
This work focuses on vector spaces over the complex numbers $\C$.
A $n$-dimensional complex vector space is denoted $\C^n$.
Its elements are written as follows.
\begin{align}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        i \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix} \in \C^2
\end{align}

A \textbf{linear map} $M$ between vector spaces $V$ and $W$ is a map $M: V \to W$ that satisfies the following two conditions.
Note that $V$ and $W$ are assumed to be vector spaces over $\C$.
\begin{align}
    \forall u, v \in V: \qquad & M(u + v) = M(u) + M(v) & \text{additivity} \\
    \forall c \in \C, v \in V: \qquad & M(c \cdot v) = c \cdot M(v) & \text{homogeneity}
\end{align}
Such a map $M$ can be expressed via a \textbf{matrix}.
Let $V \in \C^m$ and $W \in \C^n$, then $M \in \C^{n \times m}$.
This is a core concept in representation theory since the elements of groups will be represented by matrices.
