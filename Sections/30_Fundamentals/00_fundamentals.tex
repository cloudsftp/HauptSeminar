\section{Fundamentals}

This section introduces various concepts, that we will rely upon in later sections.
Since representation theory is about representing group elements as linear maps vector spaces, the introduced concepts are from these two areas of mathematics.
The first subsection focuses on group theory.
The second subsection focuses on linear algebra.
