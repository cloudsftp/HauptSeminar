\todo[inline]{
    Introduce fundamental concepts, that readers might not know.
    Decide detail/gist
}

This section introduces various concepts, that we need in later sections.
Since representation theory is about representing groups in vector spaces, the introduced concepts are from these two areas of math.
The first subsection focuses on group theory.
The second subsection focuses on linear algebra.
