\section{Classification of Representations}

For each group, there are an infinite number of possibilities to represent them with linear maps.
Therefore we want to know what the ``elementary'' representations of a group are.
In this section, we will introduce a way to combine representations to yield larger representations.
Also, this will lead to the definition of what it means for a representation to be ``elementary'' since these are representations that can not be constructed from smaller representations.
We will also see a way to write down these ``elementary'' representations in a compact way since it is infeasible to write down a matrix for every group element in large groups with potentially large representations.
