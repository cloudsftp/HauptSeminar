\section{Representation of Representations}

\todo[inline]{Different title (Classification of Representations?)}

Writing down representations takes up a lot of space since you need to write down a $n \times n$ matrix for every element.
In larger groups this is infeasible.
This chapter introduces a way to write down group representations in a compact way, hence ``representation of representations''.
Before that, we need to define how group representations can be combined and what simple and semisimple representations are.
