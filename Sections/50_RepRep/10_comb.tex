\subsection{Combining Representations}

This subsection is about building new representations from existing ones.
First, we will have a look at the direct sum $\oplus$ and the tensor product $\otimes$.
Suppose we have two representations $\rho: G \to \GL(V)$ and $\rho': G \to \GL(V')$ of some group $G$, then the combination of these using either operation $\odot \in \{\oplus, \otimes\}$ is defined as
\begin{align*}
    \forall a \in G: \qquad & (\rho \odot \rho')(a) = \rho(a) \odot \rho'(a)
\end{align*}
That means, the operator $\odot$ is applied to the linear maps of both representations of an action $a \in G$.
This is done for each action $a \in G$.
Using the operations from above, $\rho \odot \rho'$ will also be a representation of the group $G$.
By this rule, the $n$-th tensor power $\rho^{\otimes n}$ is also a representation.
Both the $n$-th outer power $\bigwedge^n(\rho)$ and the $n$-th symmetric power $\Sym^n(\rho)$ of the representation are subrepresentations of $\rho^{\otimes n}$~\cite{fulton2013}.
