\subsection{Simple Representations}

To define simple representations, we first need to understand what irreducible representations are.
A representations $\rho: G \to \GL(V)$ is \textbf{irreducible}, if there is no vector subspace $U \subset V$ exists with
\begin{align*}
    \forall a \in G: \qquad & \rho(a) \cdot U \subset U
\end{align*}
except for the trivial vector subspaces $V$ and $\{0\}$.
Such a vector subspace $U$ would be called \textbf{invariant}.
And if it existed, $\rho': G \to \GL(U)$ would be a \textbf{subrepresentation} of $\rho$.
