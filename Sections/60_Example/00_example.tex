    \label{tab:reprep.char.table}
\end{table}

\Cref{tab:reprep.char.table} is an example of a character table.
It shows all simple representations of the group $S_3$.
$S_3$ is the group of symmetries of a triangle.
$1$ is the identity element, each representation will map it to the corresponding identity matrix of its vector space.
This means that the character in that column will tell us the dimension of the vector space, the representation maps to, since $\chi_V(1) = \Tr(I_V) = \dim(V)$.
The trivial representation, triv, and the sign representation, sgn, both have dimension one, so their character shows the matrices, which the group elements are mapped onto.
The trivial representation just maps all elements to 1.

For the sign representation, we need to know, what the conjugacy classes are and what the notation means.
We think of each element as an action on a triangle as shown in \Cref{fig:reprep.char.triangle}.
The notation will tell us, which corner is mapped where.
The corner with the first number will be mapped to the corner with the second number.
If there is a third number, the corner with the second number will be mapped to the corner with the third number.
And finally, the corner with the last number will be mapped to the corner with the first number.
So the group element (12) will just swap corners 1 and 2 and the group element (123) will rotate the triangle clockwise.
Every element in the conjugacy group of (12) will invert the order of numbers from clockwise to counterclockwise and vice versa, hence the sign representation maps its elements to -1.
The identity and rotations will leave the order intact and therefore the sign representation maps 1 and every element in the conjugacy group of (123) to 1.

Assume, that every corner of the triangle in \Cref{fig:reprep.char.triangle} is associated with a value $x_i$ where $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0$.
This subspace of $\C^3$ can be thought of a 2-dimensional vector space with the basis $\{e_1 - e_2, e_2 - e_3\}$ with
\begin{align*}
    x' = \begin{pmatrix}
        x_1 - x_2 \\
        x_2 - x_3
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
The elements of $S_3$ map the values of $x_i$ between the corners as described above.
So the standard representation maps 1 to I because all $x_i$s stay the same and therefore also $x'_1 = x_1 - x_2$ and $x_2' = x_2 - x_3$.
I will write $\stand((12))$ as $s^{(12)}$ in the following for readability.
The action (12) swaps the values of $x_1$ and $x_2$.
So $s^{(12)}_{00} = -1$ and $s^{(12)}_{01} = 0$, since $x'_1$ is just negated.
For $x'_2$ it is a little more complicated, the elements of the matrix must satisfy the equality
\begin{align*}
    x_1 - x_3 & = s^{(12)}_{10} \cdot (x_1 - x_2) + s^{(12)}_{11} \cdot (x_2 - x_3) \\
    & = x_1 \cdot s^{(12)}_{10} + x_2 \cdot (s^{(12)}_{11} - s^{(12)}_{10}) + x_3 \cdot s^{(12)}_{11} \\
\end{align*}
So $s^{(12)}_{10} = s^{(12)}_{11} = 1$ and the resulting matrix is
\begin{align*}
    s^{(12)} & = \begin{pmatrix}
        -1 & 0 \\
        1 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
Its trace is 0.
We don't need to compute the matrices for the other two elements in the same conjugacy class, since the character is constant on the conjugacy classes as mentioned above.
Now we computed the values of the character of the standard representation of $S_3$ for the conjugacy classes of 1 and (12).
The value for the conjugacy class (123) is missing.
I will write $\stand((123))$ as $s^{(123)}$ in the following for readability.
For to get the correct value in $x'_1$, the elements of the matrix must satisfy the following equality
\begin{align*}
    x_2 - x_3 & = s^{(123)}_{00} \cdot (x_1 - x_2) + s^{(123)}_{01} \cdot (x_2 - x_3)
\end{align*}
So $s^{(123)}_{00} = 0$ and $s^{(123)}_{01} = 1$.
For $x'_2$ it is more complicated and the remaining elements of the matrix have to satisfy the equality
\begin{align*}
    x_3 - x_1 & = s^{(123)}_{10} \cdot (x_1 - x_2) + s^{(123)}_{11} \cdot (x_2 - x_3) \\
    & = x_1 \cdot s^{(123)}_{10} + x_2 \cdot (s^{(123)}_{11} - s^{(123)}_{10}) + x_3 \cdot s^{(123)}_{11}
\end{align*}
So $s^{(123)}_{10} = s^{(123)}_{11} = -1$ and  the resulting matrix with trace -1 is
\begin{align*}
    s^{(123)} & = \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 \\
        -1 & -1
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
