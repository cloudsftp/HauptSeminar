\section{The Example of $S_3$}

In this section, we will create the character table for the symmetric group $S_3$.
We start by describing $S_3$.
Then we will find all inequivalent irreducible representations and list their characters in a character table.

\subsection{The Group $S_3$}
\label{sec:ex.group}

The group $S_3$ consists of all possible permutations of $3$ objects.
We can think of each element as an action on a triangle as shown in \Cref{fig:reprep.char.triangle}.
Elements of the group are usually written as numbers ($1-3$) in brackets, such as $(123)$.
The notation will tell us, which corner is mapped where.
The corner with the first number will be mapped to the corner with the second number.
If there is a third number, the corner with the second number will be mapped to the corner with the third number.
And finally, the corner with the last number will be mapped to the corner with the first number.
So the group element (12) will just swap corners 1 and 2 and the group element (123) will rotate the triangle clockwise.

The group has 3 conjugacy classes.
The identity $(1)$ is its own conjugacy class, since for any $g \in S_3$ the following holds.
\begin{align}
    g \cdot (1) \cdot g^{-1} & = g \cdot g^{-1} = (1)
\end{align}
It has order 1.
Another conjugacy class is the transpositions $\{(12), (23), (13)\}$. 
Each element in this class is its own inverse, so its order is 2.
And the last conjugacy class is the rotations $\{(123), (132)\}$.
Since it takes 3 rotations to rotate the triangle by 360\textdegree, their order is 3.

    \end{tikzpicture}

\subsection{The Trivial Representation and The Sign Representation}

The easiest representation of every finite group is the trivial representation $\triv$.
We know, that it maps every group element $a \in S_3$ to the identity map of the vector space $\C^1$.
So $\triv$ is simply $\triv = 1$.
Its character therefore is $\chi_{\triv} = 1$.
This representation is irreducible because the only subspaces of a one-dimensional vector space $V$ are $V$ itself and $\{0_V\}$~\cite{fulton2013}.

The sign representation $\sgn$ is a little bit more complicated.
Suppose, we want another one-dimensional representation.
Since for one-dimensional representations, the character is identical to the representation, we can assume that the representation is constant on the conjugacy classes of $S_3$.
The identity element $(1)$ must always be represented as the identity map of the target vector space.
So $\sgn((1)) = 1$ for our one-dimensional case.
Since the elements in the conjugacy class $a \in \Cl((12))$ have order 2, we now choose to map them to $\sgn(a) = -1$ instead of $1$.
Then for any $a \in \Cl((12))$ the representation of $a \cdot a$ is $\sgn(a \cdot a) = -1 \cdot -1 = 1 = \sgn((1))$.
This reassures us, that the choice of $\sgn((a)) = -1$ is valid for the elements $a \in \Cl((12))$ because $\sgn$ acts as a homomorphism on these elements and the identity element.
Now we just need to find the representation of the elements of the conjugacy class $a \in \Cl((123))$.
We can construct the element $(123)$ from transpositions $(123) = (12) \cdot (23)$.
Since $\sgn$ is a homomorphism, we now can calculate the representation of $(123)$ and therefore of all elements in its conjugacy class $a \in \Cl((123))$.
\begin{align}
    \sgn((123)) & = \sgn((12) \cdot (23)) = \sgn((12)) \cdot \sgn((23))  = -1 \cdot -1 = 1
\end{align}
So in summary,
\begin{align}
    \sgn(a) & = \begin{cases}
        -1 & \text{ if } a \in \Cl((12)) \\
        1 & \text{ else}
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
Similarly the character is
\begin{align}
    \chi_{\sgn}(a) & = \begin{cases}
        -1 & \text{ if } a \in \Cl((12)) \\
        1 & \text{ else}
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
As for the trivial representation, this representation is also irreducible for the same reason~\cite{fulton2013}.

\subsection{The Standard Representation}

The standard representation is our first and only irreducible faithful representation.
Assume, that every corner of the triangle in \Cref{fig:reprep.char.triangle} is associated with a coordinate of $\C^3$, $x_i$.
When permutating these values, the sum stays constant.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that the sum is $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0$.
This is a subspace $V' = \{x \in \C^3 | x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0\}$ of $\C^3$, which is equivalent to $\C^2$ by the isomorphism
\begin{align}
    \pi: \qquad & V' \to \C^2, \quad \begin{pmatrix}
        x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3
    \end{pmatrix} \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}
        x_1 - x_2 \\
        x_2 - x_3
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

The elements of $S_3$ permutate the values $x_i$ as described in \Cref{sec:ex.group}.
The image if $(1)$ is $I$, like for every representation.
The image of the other elements has to be computed by its action on the vectors of $\C^2$, which can be derived from its actions on $V'$.
For example, take the element $(12)$.
Its action $\rho': S_3 \to \GL(V')$ is
\begin{align}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        x_2 \\ x_1 \\ x_3
    \end{pmatrix} = \rho'((12)) \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
        x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
Therefore, its action $\stand: G \to \GL(\C^2)$ on $\C^2$ must be
\begin{align}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        x_2 - x_1 \\
        x_1 - x_3
    \end{pmatrix} = \stand((12)) \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
        x_1 - x_2 \\
        x_2 - x_3
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
We can calculate the matrix $\stand((12))$ via two linear equations.
First, we calculate the elements in the top row.
We will write them as $s^{(12)}_{11}$ and $s^{(12)}_{12}$.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    x_2 - x_1 & = s^{(12)}_{11} \cdot (x_1 - x_2) + s^{(12)}_{12} \cdot (x_2 - x_3) \\
    & = (-1) \cdot (x_1 - x_2) \\
    \Longrightarrow \quad & s^{(12)}_{11} = -1 \land s^{(12)}_{12} = 0
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Similarly, we can get the elements in the bottom row, $s^{(12)}_{21}$ and $s^{(12)}_{22}$.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    x_1 - x_3 & = s^{(12)}_{21} \cdot (x_1 - x_2) + s^{(12)}_{22} \cdot (x_2 - x_3) \\
    & = x_1 - x_2 + x_2 - x_3 \\
    \Longrightarrow \quad & s^{(12)}_{21} = 1 \land s^{(12)}_{22} = 1
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

We can do this for every element in $S_3$ and will get the following matrices.

    \begin{tabular}{c c c}
        $(1) \mapsto I$ & $(123) \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}

            1 & 0
        \end{pmatrix}$ & $(132) \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}
            0 & 1 \\
            -1 & -1
        \end{pmatrix}$ \\\\ $(12) \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}
            -1 & 0 \\
            1 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}$ & $(13) \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}
            0 & -1 \\
            -1 & 0
        \end{pmatrix}$ & $(23) \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 1 \\
            0 & -1
        \end{pmatrix}$
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
