\subsection{Infinite Representation}

An example of an infinite-dimensional representation of a group would be the infinite-dimensional representation of the group $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$.
It is the group of all $2 \times 2$ real matrices with a determinant of one.
From this definition, you can immediately see, that there exists at least one finite-dimensional representation of this group.

To describe this infinite-dimensional representation, we first need to find generators of the group $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$.
In this case, there are three and we will call them $E$, $F$, and $H$.
They need to satisfy the following equations:
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        [H, E] & = 2E \\
        [H, F] & = -2F \\
        [E, F] & = H
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $[A, B] = A \cdot B - B \cdot A$ is the so called commutator of $A$ and $B$.
The matrices satisfying these equations are
\begin{align}
    H = -i \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 \\
        -1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}, \qquad
    E = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & i \\
        -i & 1
    \end{pmatrix}, \text{ and} \qquad
    F = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & -i \\
        -i & 1
    \end{pmatrix} 
\end{align}
