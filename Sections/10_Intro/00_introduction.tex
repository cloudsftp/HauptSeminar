\section{Introduction}

Representation theory is a mathematical branch, that investigates the structure of groups.
It does so by \textit{representing} group elements as linear maps in vector spaces.
Since group elements are thought of as actions acting on something, it makes sense to represent them by maps, and not elements of vector spaces.
The idea is to represent group elements as their actions on some vector space.
The vector space is then also called a $G$-module, and the mapping of the group elements to the linear maps is called the representation.

Linear algebra is a well-studied branch of mathematics, sometimes called a workhorse.
Representing groups as linear maps, therefore, makes it easier to study them.
