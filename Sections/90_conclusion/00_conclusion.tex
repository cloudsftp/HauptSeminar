\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we saw what the basics of representation theory are, as well as some of the most important results in representation theory such as Mashke's Theorem and Shur's Lemma.
The application of these results was demonstrated using the symmetric group $S_3$.
The standard representation of that group, and the class of groups $S_n$ respectively, was shown to have an impact on the utility of these groups as platforms for specific cryptographic key-exchange protocols.
