\section{Related Work}

This document is an introductory document for the topic of representation theory.
Therefore, the majority of works used are also introductory documents.

Fulton and Harris write a book called ``Representation theory: a first course''~\cite{fulton2013}.
It is a good introduction to the topic of representation theory and lays out the basics.
It does only cover finite-dimensional representations.

A similar work in german language is the book ``Einf√ºhrung in die Struktur- und Darstellungstheorie der klassischen Gruppen'' by Hein~\cite{hein2013}.
This book also covers definitions of groups and vector spaces in depth.
So it is better for people that don't have a lot of knowledge of vector spaces.
The following section will also cover the fundamentals of group theory and linear algebra to remind the reader of these concepts.
