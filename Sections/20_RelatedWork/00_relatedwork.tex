Fulton and Harris wrote a book called ``Representation theory: a first course''~\cite{fulton2013}.
It is a good introduction to the topic of representation theory and lays out the basics.
It only covers finite-dimensional representations.

A similar work in german language is the book ``Einf√ºhrung in die Struktur- und Darstellungstheorie der klassischen Gruppen'' by Hein~\cite{hein2013}.
This book also covers definitions of groups and vector spaces in depth, therefore serving as a good introduction to vector spaces.
The following section will also cover the fundamentals of group theory and linear algebra to remind the reader of these concepts.
